Information is obtained from (scientific) research and contacts with doctors, therapists, cockpit- and cabin crew and frequent flyers. All this experience and knowledge will be pooled and shared, and used to develop treatment protocols. From this point of view we invite everyone who will be able and is willing to contribute, to [contact us](/contact-eng.md/) at **Stichting Fly Aware**.  

Aviation has many challenges which can be of influence at ones health situation. Being aware of this, makes one well prepared to do their job or to travel. We believe in prevention and will spread this. Prevention starts with awareness. By advising weâ€™ll bring this to life.
