Stichting Fly Aware offers help to address these problems. Our aim is to contribute to the development of a reliable test that will unambiguously prove exposure to, and possible damage caused by Organo Phosphates. 

Furthermore we focus on sharing information of treatment protocols for people affected by neurological disorders that preclude their proper functioning. Stichting Fly Aware features a team of medical practitioners and therapists, with a lot of experience in this area.
