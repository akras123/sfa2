## Bleed Air

The air conditioning system of an aircraft gets its fresh air from the first part of the engines, the compressors. Because of the design of the compressor bearing seals, some oil leakage will occur regularly, especially when the power setting is changed (e.g. during take off, climb, descent). This happens even in a perfectly healthy engine! As a result, smoke and burnt/pyrolised engine oil vapours can prevail in the air conditioning system in cabin and cockpit. During a so called Fume Event, much higher levels of contamination occur. The contaminated air in the aircraft cabins are a serious threat to the health of both crew and passengers.

Aircrew regularly display a variety of symptoms of ill health. Especially after fume events, when smell (of wet dog or dirty socks) and smoke appear in the aircraft cabin due to oil leakage into the Bleed Air system. These suddenly appearing symptoms, during or immediately after a fume event are very similar to those after exposure to carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and similar substances. The same symptoms also occur after so called Long Term Low Level Exposure.


## Organo Phosphates

The Organo Phosphate Tricresyl Phosphate (TCP) and isomers which are present in burnt oil, cause chronical problems for the central nervous system in the human body. This can give serious health problems, which are reflected in particular in motor skills, memory and coordination.
