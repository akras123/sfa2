As you know, <b>Stichting Fly Aware</b> is a knowledge and information centre,
that wants to help you start every flight fit, energetic and vital.  

From this expertise, several tests and treatment protocols have been developed, a.o. a
treatment to improve neurological issues possibly caused by flying.

In the future more (scientific) research is required however. Stichting Fly Aware is committed to contribute to this,
for which obviously money will be needed.  
Therefore we are looking for sponsors and donors. You can help us here very easily, without any cost involved from your side!  
Every time you want to place an on line order, please use
