## What is orthomolecular?

Orthomolecular medicine strives to work with substances our body can use and process without any harm. Orthos means: right or healthy. Molecular stands for molecules.
Nutrition plays a prominent role here. During your intake, Drs. John Midavaine (Orthomolecular Doctor) will advise you about nutrition and if necessary add supplements. 
The good thing about this method is that it always uses natural substances which the body recognises and can absorb. It is a powerful support for the body, feeding it with body-building substances and “molecules” that are needed for detoxify from the toxins you were exposed to during your flight,

Testimonial:
>“During the intake John advised me to take some supplements. I couldn’t move my legs properly, they felt like concrete. As a cabin attendant I experienced several fume events and some time later my health was deteriorating. The supplements actually gave me more energy, right from the beginning. My faeces got a different color and my urine got a strong smell. John told me this was due to the detoxication.”
