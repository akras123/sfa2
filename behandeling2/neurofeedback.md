## What is Neurofeedback?  

Neurofeedback is a method of treatment for the brain, in which one can learn to control ones own brain waves.  

Neurofeedback is based on the principles of Operant Conditioning, a technique in which behaviour is being influenced by reward and punishment. During this treatment, the brain waves are influenced by a reward (for example a sound or short film) every time they show the desired pattern.

## The body strives for balance 

The body operates perfect when it is in balance. Many psychological and physical problems develop when there is a unbalance in different bodysystems. Most of the time, the first symptoms consist of vague problems, for which the regular medical science have no adequate diagnosis. This may lead to a chain reaction of diseases. It is important to not just treat the symptoms, but also find the source of the diseases and cure them. 

## Nerve gas is a neurotoxin…

and can have as a result that your brains don't perform as good anymore as they used to. It looks as if different “pathways” are being used. These different “pathways” can perform in a very disturbing way. Disorders as memory-loss, difficulties with figures and calculating can occur. With a “quality EEG” will be registered which part of your brain has been deranged.

## The treatment

According to your Quality EEG, the baseline measurement, a trainingsprogram for your brain will be written. After some treatments another Quality EEG will be made to evaluate the process.

Testimonial:
>“The effect of the first sequence of treatments with Neurofeedback, I’ll never forget.
After the treatment I went to a shopping centre and there I stopped abrupt.
Suddenly I felt myself aware of what happened all around me.
It has been for months that I couldn’t keep up with the tempo of my environment.
For me only 2 bits a second entered my brain…..like in a movie in slowmotion, which also run a few minutes behind in time
with reality. ….and all of a sudden in that shopping centre, the film was running like normal again. That was embolden!”
