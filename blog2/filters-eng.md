One of the challenges when flying is not to inhale any toxic substances. At the time there are many study results. Depending on the "independance" of the researchers, the measured levels of toxic substances vary from "clearly present" to "barely measurable". On our web site you'll find a number of these studies.

Honestly speaking, in case of any doubt I choose for my health. While researchers and other related organisations keep arguing, I am the one to bear the results of possibly contaminated air, and since I am now aware of this phnomenon, I choose to take preventative measures against intoxication.

This in itself is quite a search. The air in cabin and cockpit comes as unfiltered bleed air from the engines. It is therefore to be expected that the fingerprint of the oil is in this air. Furthermore the engines wear with every cycle they make, causing heavy metals and several other alloys to be present, too. How can this be filtered from the cabin air?

In the Aerotoxic scene, numerous face masks are suggested. But what type of mask will ensure that the air on board can be safely inhaled? In cooperation with the Kunduz Laboratories in Strassbourg, Safety Experts Van der Putte Medical Nederland and Jan van Woerkum (who is presently developing a face mask, in which also Michel Mulder is involved), I am brainstorming about a good, functional filter.

A decent mask should consist of 4 parts:

1. Absorption. The absorption layer is made of activated carbon. Activated carbon is able to bind a.o. organo phosphates.
2. Hepa. In short: bleed air is in general recycled, and mixed with "fresh" bleed air. A Hepa filter is needed to filter out any micro organisms. As the air is recycled several times, and thus is breathed in and out repeatedly, numerous micro organisms will be added.
3. Aerosol. The bleed air will contain micro droplets of burnt/pyrolised oil.
4. Gases. This is self explanatory.

The mask should meet the following requirements:
. It must have a good fit. Any air leaks will cause unfiltered air to be breathed in, a good fit will prevent this.
. Comfortable to breath through for a longer period.
. An indication when the filter is full or needs replacement.

What are the option at the time?

1: FFP3 mask

There is a lot of talk about FFP3 masks. These are dust caps which can be applied in several areas. Pay attention to choose the correct type of FFP3 filter! They come in various price- and quality ranges.

Pro: Easy to take along and low cost: between €10 and €25 each. Can be easily ordered on line.
Con: fitting level is limited, gets warm while being used. Limited protection against toxines. When eating or drinking, the mask will have to be taken off, so the breathed air will be unfiltered.

2: Half face gas mask with P3/A2 qualification.
![mask halfgelaat narda.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mask halfgelaat narda.jpeg)

Pro: good protection against hazardous substances, as described under the 4 requirements of a mask. Affordable for the level of protection, cost €100 to €200.
Con: Heavy, uncomfortable. Requires active breathing in and out. This is acceptable on a short flight, but on longer fligths this is too tiring. Our natural breathing system is not based on active breathing out. Here too, during meals or drinking the mask will have to be taken off.

3: Cleanspace2 with a half face mask.
![mask clean space 2 Narda.jpeg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/mask clean space 2 Narda.jpeg)

Pro: breathing out is actively supported by a small fan. Breathing goes easily and can be maintained for a longer period. The filter part is located behind your head. Thus there is no heavy filter hanging on the half face mask.
Con: the filter is now behind your head, and it's about 10cm thick. This complicates sitting in a cabin seat. You will need a pillow behind your back to create space for the filter. This is not very comfortable on longer fligths, especially when you want to get some sleep. Cost: over €1,000.

I have tested all 3 options mentioned above. For short fligths, a half face mask works best for me. Far from ideal, but better than nothing. The Cleanspace 2, no matter how good the equipment may be, I couldn't wear for more than an hour during the flight, because I wasn't sitting comfortably, and I got bothered by hot spots in my face by the mask, and by the weight of the filter.

I personally have my doubts about the functionality of the FFP3 filters. When using a gas mask, when I smell the cabin air during the flight, I smell Ozon en the smell of "too fresh outside air". This will normally not be observed, as the present organo phosphates will cut out the smelling organs. When using an FFP3 mask during flight, and take it off, I don't smell any Ozon. What does this mean? Do the organo phosphates penetrate through the filter? Or is the mask not tight enough?

Together with Safety Experts Van der Putte Medical, I'm presently brainstorming about another device. Also a system with a nasal canula and a filter on your belt is being developed. Promising options for the future! I hope I can test them soon on one of my next flights.

But for now... detoxifying with the Raymedy protocol, MSM supplements and lots of sleep...!
